Trains and railways have been a 'model' of innovation for hundreds of years, leading to advances in industry, agriculture, and transportation. Powered by steam, diesel fuel, or electricity, trains represent one of the most important ways that people and goods travel. Trains have also been a staple of pop culture and have been featured in some of our favorite movies. From Thomas the Tank Engine to The Hogwarts Express, these favorites take us on adventures and spark our imaginations. What is YOUR favorite? Today, trains and railways embody the technological advancements we've seen accelerate around the globe. From smart sensors and automated inspection equipment to computer programs that maximize fuel use, trains continue to carry us into the future.

### Train Time
Before trains, every town across the country set their own clocks based on solar noon, the moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. In Milwaukee, solar noon happens about a minute before it happens in Waukesha and about 14 minutes before it happens in Eau Claire. Clocks were different everywhere you went, but no one could get anywhere fast enough for it to matter. Then trains happened. Trains need schedules, not just for passengers, but also for safety. If your local clock is 14 minutes faster or slower than someone else's local clock, how can you coordinate? Railway companies were the first to set standard times. Trains ran on standardized timetables set by the companies. To a railway company, it was the same time in Chicago and Eau Claire as it was in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Eventually, the railroad companies convinced governments to divide North America into five time zones. Today, the United States has nine different time zones.

### Staying on Track
How do trains stay on the tracks? Trains are massive and they have a lot of momentum. Newton's 1st Law of Motion says that objects that are moving want to keep moving in a straight line. But train routes aren't perfectly straight lines. When something with wheels goes around a curve, the outside wheels have farther to go and need to turn faster. The wheels on a car turn at different speeds thanks to something called a differential. Trains don't have a differential. Their wheels turn at the same speed. What's the solution? Train wheels aren't cylinders, they're cone-shaped and wider on the inside. If the track curves to the right, the train shifts to the left. Because the wheels have a slight cone shape, and are wider on the inside, the left wheels are now just a little bigger than the wheels on the right. This means that the left wheels travel a little bit farther than the ones on the right, all while turning at the same speed. Self-correcting wheels keep trains on the tracks.",English,Simplified

6,Automation Everywhere,Dream Machine,1,"### Sensor

#### 1. Tiny Light Sensors
These are small sensors that can detect light and send a signal.

#### 2. Beam Breakers
These sensors shine a light beam. When something gets in the way, like your foam sheet, the sensor sends a message to the Dream Machine's computer brain. This computer brain knows where everything is, so it knows where the object is too.

#### 3. Metal Detectors
These sensors work like metal detectors. They check for metal objects nearby. If the object is close, the sensor sends a strong signal. If it's far away, the signal is weak. This helps the machine know if a gate is open or closed.

#### 4. Light Beams
How does the machine find your order? These sensors send out a harmless red light beam. When something blocks the beam, the sensor says, ""Hey, something's here!"" The computer brain knows where the sensor is, so it knows exactly where the object is.

#### Safety Sensors
You might have noticed the acrylic walls around this exhibit. They're here for your safety. These machines are programmed to do their job, but they don't know you're here. They won't stop until they get a signal to stop. To keep people safe, factories use sensors on doors that can detect if they're open or closed. These sensors use special radio signals and metal detectors to tell the machine if the doors are open or closed. If the doors are closed, the machine works just fine. If they're open, the machine stops.",English,Standard

#### 1. 42KD Miniature Photoelectric Sensors
A very tiny version of the Rockwell Automation photoelectric sensor.

#### 2. Rightsight Photoelectric Sensors
These sensors emit a beam of light. When an object like your foam sheet interrupts the beam, the sensor sends a signal to the Programmable Automation Controller or PAC. The PAC is the computer brain of the Dream Machine. It knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is.

#### 3. 871P Versacube Inductive Proximity Sensors
Inductive Proximity Sensors work just like a metal detector. They generate an electromagnetic (EM) field to detect metal objects. The EM field induces a second EM field in a nearby metal object. The strength of the second EM field depends on the distance from the sensor to the object being sensed. Here,
Inductive Proximity Sensors indicate if the Infeed Gate is open or closed.
If the EM field is weak, that means the gate is open. If the EM field is strong, the gate is closed.
Inductive proximity sensors are used in food processing and manufacturing, robotic welding, and for packaging/ materials handling.

#### 4. Visisight Sensors Photoelectric Sensors
How does the machine ""know"" where your order is? These sensors emit an eye-safe beam of red light. When something interrupts the beam, the sensor communicates that an object was detected. The ControlLogix Programmable Automation Controller (PAC), the computer brain of the Dream Machine, knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is the instant it interrupts the beam. VisiSight Photoelectric Sensors are used in packaging, materials handling, and sortation.

#### Sensaguard RFID
You may have noticed that this exhibit is enclosed with acrylic panels. That's for your safety. These machines are smart, but they don't know you're here. They are programmed to do a specific thing and won't stop until they receive a signal to stop. Safety is incredibly important in factories and on assembly lines. Of course, people need to access these machines to perform troubleshooting and maintenance. That's why there are doors with SensaGuard sensors on them. SensaGuard sensors use a combination of RFID technology (radio signals that read a chip) and inductive proximity sensors (to detect metal) to let the machines know whether the panel doors are open or closed. If closed, everything runs just fine. If open, the machine stops.",English,Technical

This cabinet is the brain of the Dream Machine. It helps control all the machines and sensors that work together to make the Dream Machine run.

### Precise Motors
The Dream Machine uses special motors called servos that can be controlled very precisely. They can move to exact positions and speeds. The brain of the Dream Machine sends signals to these motors, telling them what to do.

### Sensors and Controls
The Dream Machine has many sensors that watch what's happening and send information to the brain. The brain then decides what needs to happen next.

### Connected Control
The Dream Machine uses a special network that lets all the parts talk to each other. This makes it easier to control the whole system and makes it cheaper to set up and fix. It even lets people control the Dream Machine from far away.",English,Standard
7,Automation Everywhere,Dream Machine: Control Cabinet,3,"### Control Cabinet
This cabinet houses the electronic brain of the Dream Machine. All the sensors, the AC motors, the laser cutters, and everything else are controlled by the ControlLogix Programmable Automation Controller or PAC.

### Kinetix Servo Drives
Servos are a very precise and accurate electric motor. You can control their position, how fast they move, and how quickly they accelerate. Servo motors are controlled by servo drives. The Programmable Automation Controller or PAC (the computer brain of the Dream Machine) sends control signals to the Kinetix Servo Drives. The drives amplify these signals and send them to the servos. Here in the Dream Machine, Kinetix Servo Drives provide the motion control for the servo motors that move the laser cutters.

### Armorblock I/O
The Rockwell Automation ArmorBlock I/O gathers information from the sensors and sends it to the Programmable Automation Controller (the computer brain), which determines what needs to be done.

### Ethernet Control
One feature of Rockwell Automation systems is the Ethernet network, which allows all the systems to process information and communicate over a single network. Ethernet control gives operators a lot more control over the entire system. It also saves money on wiring and troubleshooting. And you can monitor and operate your factory from anywhere in the world.",English,Technical

29,Innovation Station,Spark Gap Telegraph,3,"Wireless Telegraph
=====================

In the late 1800s, the telegraph was the only way to send an instant message to someone. The telegraph transformed the world and made communication much easier across distances. The problem was wires. You can't run wires from the shore to a ship, and ships were incredibly important to the global economy. People needed instant communication everywhere, and they needed to get rid of the wires.

Warren Johnson's initial transmitter set-up consisted of:
- A battery
- A capacitor
- An induction coil
- A spark gap

When you complete the circuit, the induction coil transforms low-voltage electricity from the battery into a high-voltage impulse, which jumps across the gap. This generates a pulse of radio waves that flies off in every direction. A coherer (radio-wave receiver) located somewhere else picks up this pulse of radio waves as a burst of static. A short burst of static became a Morse Code dot. A longer burst became a dash.

Eventually, Johnson and his engineer Charles Fortier demonstrated their wireless telegraph system at the 1900 Paris Exposition with luminaries like Nikola Tesla, Guglielmo Marconi, and Thomas Edison.",English,Standard
29,Innovation Station,Spark Gap Telegraph,3,"Spark Gap Telegraph
=====================

Imagine sending a message to someone on the other side of the ocean in just a second. Before phones and internet, people used a machine called the telegraph to send instant messages. But telegraphs needed wires, and that was a problem for ships at sea. Ships were very important for trade, and people needed a way to talk to them quickly.

A man named Warren Johnson found a way to send messages without wires. He used a special setup that included:
- a battery
- a special coil
- a gap that sparks when electricity jumps across it

When you turn it on, the coil makes a burst of energy that sends a signal through the air. Someone else can pick up this signal with a special receiver and hear a ""click"" or a "" Static"". This was like a secret code that only they could understand.

Johnson showed off his invention to some very famous people, like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. It was a big deal!",English,Simplified

### I Could Create a Code!

You could create a code. Each letter might be combination of short and long bursts of electricity. Dots and dashes (and empty space). Tiny bits of empty space between letters. Longer bits of empty space between words. You want your code to be as efficient as possible, so you assign the shortest series of dots and dashes to the letters we use most frequently.

How Fast is Sound?

Have you ever wondered how we measure the speed of sound?

A scientist named August Kundt figured it out in 1886. He created a special kind of sound, a pure tone, inside a tube. The sound made tiny particles of dust inside the tube vibrate and form a pattern. By looking at the pattern, Kundt could see the sound wave!

### Theremin

This instrument is ""hands-off""! The Theremin makes sound without being touched. It works by detecting how close you are to its two antennas.

Moving your hands closer or farther away from the antennas changes the electric charge, which the theremin translates into sound.",English,Simplified
51,MKE Muscle,Bernoulli Table,2,"### Bernoulli's Principle & Flight
Have you ever wondered how airplanes fly? It's actually pretty cool! Fluids, like air or water, push harder when they're moving slowly. The shape of an airplane wing helps it lift off the ground. The curved top of the wing makes the air move faster, which means it pushes less hard. The flat bottom of the wing makes the air move slower, which means it pushes harder. This helps the airplane lift up into the air!",English,Simplified

### Bernoulli's Principle & Flight
Slower moving fluids (liquid or gas) exert more pressure than faster moving fluids. An aircraft's wing is curved on top and flat on the bottom.

53,MKE Muscle,Excavator,2,"**Make a Big Impact**

Imagine you need to move a really heavy rock. You can use a special machine called a lever to help lift it. But what if you need to move something even heavier? That's where our excavator comes in. It uses special parts called hydraulic cylinders to move heavy things. These cylinders help make the machine stronger by multiplying the force it uses.

**How it Works**

Our excavator uses a special system called a hydraulic circuit. It's like a tiny highway for liquid that helps the machine move. The circuit has a pump that pushes the liquid through hoses, kind of like how electricity flows through wires. The liquid helps the machine's parts move, like the arm and bucket.

**Why is this Machine so Cool?**

* It's simple: it doesn't need lots of complicated parts.
* It's efficient: it gets the job done with less effort.
* It's powerful: it can move really heavy things with ease.
* It's easy to control: you can make big things happen with just a small action.
* It's flexible: it can reach into tight spaces to get the job done.

**Force**

A force is a push or a pull that makes something move.

**Pressure**

Pressure is when you use force on a small area, making it stronger.",English,Standard
53,MKE Muscle,Excavator,2,"### Multiplying the Multiplier

A lever can help you lift a boulder. A lever and a hydraulic cylinder can help you move a mountain. On this excavator, each hydraulic cylinder is attached to a moving part of the excavator. The pressure from the hydraulic pump is multiplied by the cylinder and again by the boom, arm, and bucket, which act like levers.

### The Hydraulic Circuit

A hydraulic circuit is kind of like an electrical circuit.

There are hoses instead of wires and fluid instead of electricity. Instead of the electromotive force (Volts) pushing electrons along, a pump pushes fluid through the circuit. In a hydraulic circuit, the engine turns the hydraulic pump. The pump pushes fluid through a hose to the control valve. Valves choose the route the fluid takes. For instance, the valve can route the fluid to extend or retract the cylinder's piston. The pistons inside the cylinders extend and contract the arm, and the bucket.

### Why Hydraulic Power?

*   **Simplicity!** Eliminate the gears, cams, chain drives, and pulleys.
*   **Efficiency!** Fewer moving parts means a more efficient machine!
*   **Power!** Transform small forces into incredibly large forces!
*   **Control!** Manage large forces with small forces!
*   **Flexibility!** Transmit force into difficult spaces!

The Sun produces energy through the process of thermonuclear fusion. In the Sun's core, the extreme pressure fuses hydrogen atoms together, producing helium atoms. This fusion releases a monstrous amount of energy in the form of high-energy gamma rays. As these gamma rays bounce their way from the center of the Sun to its surface, they lose some energy and become mostly ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. Energy from the Sun's core can take anywhere from **10,000** to **170,000 years** to reach its surface. From there, it takes about **eight minutes** to reach the Earth. It takes **5.5 hours** for light from the Sun to reach Pluto.

Transforming the Sun
----------------------

The energy stored in oil, coal, and natural gas comes from the Sun. The energy stored in the wind and flowing water comes from the Sun. Even the energy stored in the food you eat comes from the Sun. We transform this stored energy. Wood into heat. Wind into the movement of ships. Water into the motion of millstones. Food into muscle, work, ideas, and technology. Coal into heat into steam into spinning turbines and generators into electricity. Electricity into light, heat, work, information, computation, and machine intelligence.

================================

The Sun is a really big ball of hot, glowing gas. It's the reason we have life on Earth and it gives us the energy we need to survive. Every year, the Earth gets a huge amount of energy from the Sun - about 400 times more than we use. This energy makes the weather and helps plants grow. We can't make energy on Earth, but we can change the energy from the Sun into different types. Plants turn some of the Sun's energy into food, and we use energy from different sources like coal, oil, and wind.

The Sun's Energy
-----------------

The Sun makes energy by squishing together tiny particles called atoms. This makes a lot of energy that travels to the Earth in just 8 minutes. The energy from the Sun is what makes things move, grow, and work. We use the Sun's energy to power our homes, schools, and computers.

You and the Sun
----------------

The Sun's energy is all around us. It's in the food we eat, the wind that blows, and the water that flows. We use the Sun's energy to do all sorts of things like cook food, sail ships, and light our homes. The Sun is what makes life on Earth possible. **The Sun Powers Life.

75,Power On,Tornado,3,"Here is the text with recovered formatting in markdown:

# Destruction
Tornadoes can toss cars and trucks around like toys, rip trees out of the ground, and tear buildings apart. Pound for pound, tornadoes are the most energetic and destructive storms on the planet.

# Wisconsin Tornadoes
Wisconsin averages 23 tornadoes each year. We had 62 back in 2005. We only had four in 2012. Wisconsin tornadoes, on average, last for under 10 minutes and touch ground for three to five miles. The Chetek tornado in May 2017 was on the ground for about two hours and cut an 83-mile path through Wisconsin. Chetek is 40 miles north of Eau Claire.

# Heat Energy
Warm, moist air lifts upward as cooler air sinks downward causing rotation within a thunderstorm.

# Kinetic Energy
A funnel of swirling air snakes downward from the storm to the ground with winds that can reach speeds of over 300 miles per hour.",English,Standard
75,Power On,Tornado,3,"### Destruction

Tornadoes are really powerful storms that can throw cars and trucks around, uproot trees, and tear down buildings. They are the strongest storms on Earth.

#### Wisconsin Tornadoes

Wisconsin gets around 23 tornadoes every year. Some years we get a lot more, like in 2005 when we had 62. Other years, like 2012, we only get a few. Most tornadoes in Wisconsin don't last very long - usually around 10 minutes - and don't travel very far. But sometimes, like with the Chetek tornado in 2017, they can be on the ground for a long time and travel a long way.

#### What Makes a Tornado

When warm air rises and cooler air sinks, it makes the air around it start to spin. This spinning air is the start of a tornado.

#### Tornado Wind

As the spinning air touches the ground, it forms a funnel that can make really strong winds - sometimes over 300 miles per hour!",English,Simplified
76,Power On,Touch Lightning,1,"**Could we Harness Lightning Energy?**
We could, but it probably wouldn't be worth it. Lightning produces a huge amount of energy within a short amount of time. Capturing it is possible, but storing that energy would be difficult and expensive. Lightning is also wildly unpredictable and thunderstorms are somewhat rare, so it would be an unreliable source of power. And even if we could capture and store a significant percentage of lightning energy, it would amount to an insignificant fraction of the world's energy needs.

**Kinetic Energy**
Rain, hail, and frozen water collide inside a storm cloud.
The kinetic energy of these collisions is transformed.

**Electrical Energy**
The top of the cloud becomes positively charged and the base of the cloud becomes negatively charged. Because like charges repel, everything on the ground underneath the cloud becomes positively charged as electrons scramble to get out of the way.

Fingers of electrical energy called ""stepped leaders"" reach down from the cloud to the ground, searching for the path of least resistance. The ground sends up a bolt of energy called a ""streamer"" to meet them. The leader and streamer connect, creating a conductive pathway.

**Heat, Light, Electrical, and Sound Energy**
That connection creates a ferocious blast of light, heat, sound, and electrical energy - lightning and thunder!",English,Standard
76,Power On,Touch Lightning,1,"**Harnessing Lightning Energy**
Imagine capturing the power of a lightning bolt! While it's possible, it wouldn't be very practical. Lightning has a lot of energy, but it's hard to store and use. Plus, thunderstorms are unpredictable and don't happen often enough to be a good source of power.

**What Creates Lightning?**
 Inside a storm cloud, water and ice bump into each other, creating energy. This energy builds up and eventually turns into electricity.

**The Power of Lightning**
The cloud gets electrically charged, and the ground below it gets charged too. This creates a pathway for the electricity to follow. When the pathway is complete, a huge burst of energy shoots out - that's lightning!

**Lightning's Big Impact**
Lightning is incredibly hot and bright, creating thunder and shaking the air around it. It's an amazing display of nature's power!",English,Simplified
77,Power On,Van de Graaff,1,"### Kinetic Energy Into Electric Potential

Inside the Van de Graaff generator, a drive belt spins over rollers made of different materials, which separates positive and negative charges. A metal brush at the base of the generator conducts negative charge to the ground. Another metal brush at the top of the generator conducts excess positive charge to the metal collector dome. The dome becomes positively charged.

#### Why do you get Shocked?

There's a big difference in electrical charge between you and the Van de Graaff generator. That electrical charge is looking for the path of least resistance. When you reach out to touch the metal dome, you become the path of least resistance. The charge jumps from the dome to you.

#### When you hold your hand on the dome, you become positively charged.

#### Share this Excess Positive Charge with your Friends!

This shock is harmless. An electrical outlet or a power line charge is much more powerful and can be deadly. Do not play with electrical outlets or power lines.",English,Standard
77,Power On,Van de Graaff,1,"# Fun with Electricity!
 Inside the Van de Graaff generator, a special belt spins around and helps create static electricity. This makes the dome on top become super charged!

## Why Do You Get a Shock?
When you touch the dome, you help the electricity find a new path. This means the electricity jumps from the dome to you!

## You Become a Human Conductor!
When you hold your hand on the dome, you become charged too!
