All-Aboard,All-Aboard,1,"All Aboard!
Trains and railways have been a 'model' of innovation for hundreds of years, leading to advances in industry, agriculture, and transportation. Powered by steam, diesel fuel, or electricity, trains represent one of the most important ways that people and goods travel. Trains have also been a staple of pop culture and have been featured in some of our favorite movies. From Thomas the Tank Engine to The Hogwarts Express, these favorites take us on adventures and spark our imaginations. What is YOUR favorite? Today, trains and railways embody the technological advancements we've seen accelerate around the globe. From smart sensors and automated inspection equipment to computer programs that maximize fuel use, trains continue to carry us into the future.
Train Time
Before trains, every town across the country set their own clocks based on solar noon, the moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. In Milwaukee, solar noon happens about a minute before it happens in Waukesha and about 14 minutes before it happens in Eau Claire. Clocks were different everywhere you went, but no one could get anywhere fast enough for it to matter. Then trains happened. Trains need schedules, not just for passengers, but also for safety. If your local clock is 14 minutes faster or slower than someone else's local clock, how can you coordinate? Railway companies were the first to set standard times. Trains ran on standardized timetables set by the companies. To a railway company, it was the same time in Chicago and Eau Claire as it was in Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Eventually, the railroad companies convinced governments to divide North America into five time zones. Today, the United States has nine different time zones.
Staying on Track
How do trains stay on the tracks? Trains are massive and they have a lot of momentum. Newton's 1st Law of Motion says that objects that are moving want to keep moving in a straight line. But train routes aren't perfectly straight lines. When something with wheels goes around a curve, the outside wheels have farther to go and need to turn faster. The wheels on a car turn at different speeds thanks to something called a differential. Trains don't have a differential. Their wheels turn at the same speed. What's the solution? Train wheels aren't cylinders, they're cone-shaped and wider on the inside. If the track curves to the right, the train shifts to the left. Because the wheels have a slight cone shape, and are wider on the inside, the left wheels are now just a little bigger than the wheels on the right. This means that the left wheels travel a little bit farther than the ones on the right, all while turning at the same speed. Self-correcting wheels keep trains on the tracks."

Automation Everywhere,Dream Machine,1,"Sensor
1. 42KD Miniature Photoelectric Sensors
A very tiny version of the Rockwell Automation photoelectric sensor.
2. Rightsight™ Photoelectric Sensors
These sensors emit a beam of light. When an object like your foam sheet interrupts the beam, the sensor sends a signal to the Programmable Automation Controller or PAC. The PAC is the computer brain of the Dream Machine. It knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is.
3. 871P Versacube™ Inductive Proximity Sensors
Inductive Proximity Sensors work just like a metal detector. They generate an electromagnetic (EM) field to detect metal objects. The EM field induces a second EM field in a nearby metal object. The strength of the second EM field depends on the distance from the sensor to the object being sensed. Here,
Inductive Proximity Sensors indicate if the Infeed Gate is open or closed.
If the EM field is weak, that means the gate is open. If the EM field is strong, the gate is closed.
Inductive proximity sensors are used in food processing and manufacturing, robotic welding, and for packaging/ materials handling.
4. Visisight™ Sensors Photoelectric Sensors
How does the machine ""know"" where your order is? These sensors emit an eye-safe beam of red light. When something interrupts the beam, the sensor communicates that an object was detected. The ControlLogix® Programmable Automation Controller (PAC), the computer brain of the Dream Machine, knows where each sensor is, so it knows where the object is the instant it interrupts the beam. VisiSight™ Photoelectric Sensors are used in packaging, materials handling, and sortation.
Sensaguard™ RFID
You may have noticed that this exhibit is enclosed with acrylic panels. That's for your safety. These machines are smart, but they don't know you're here. They are programmed to do a specific thing and won't stop until they receive a signal to stop. Safety is incredibly important in factories and on assembly lines. Of course, people need to access these machines to perform troubleshooting and maintenance. That's why there are doors with SensaGuard™ sensors on them. SensaGuard™ sensors use a combination of RFID technology (radio signals that read a chip) and inductive proximity sensors (to detect metal) to let the machines know whether the panel doors are open or closed. If closed, everything runs just fine. If open, the machine stops.

Automation Everywhere,Dream Machine: Control Cabinet,3,"Control Cabinet
This cabinet houses the electronic brain of the Dream Machine. All the sensors, the AC motors, the laser cutters, and everything else are controlled by the ControlLogix® Programmable Automation Controller or PAC.
Kinetix® Servo Drives
Servos are a very precise and accurate electric motor. You can control their position, how fast they move, and how quickly they accelerate. Servo motors are controlled by servo drives. The Programmable Automation Controller or PAC (the computer brain of the Dream Machine) sends control signals to the Kinetix® Servo Drives. The drives amplify these signals and send them to the servos. Here in the Dream Machine, Kinetix® Servo Drives provide the motion control for the servo motors that move the laser cutters.
Armorblock® I/O
The Rockwell Automation ArmorBlock® I/O gathers information from the sensors and sends it to the Programmable Automation Controller (the computer brain), which determines what needs to be done.
Ethernet Control
One feature of Rockwell Automation systems is the Ethernet network, which allows all the systems to process information and communicate over a single network. Ethernet control gives operators a lot more control over the entire system. It also saves money on wiring and troubleshooting. And you can monitor and operate your factory from anywhere in the world."

Big,Fern Fossil in Shale,0,"Fern Fossils in Shale
Shale is a sedimentary rock that forms as silt and mud sink to the bottom of marshes, river deltas, and lakes. Time and pressure turn the mud into rock. Shale often forms the ""cap"" or roof of a coal seam. Black shale contains a lot of carbon, and forms when there is little or no oxygen in the mud. Organisms die and sink to the bottom. Layers of mud slowly settle on them. Time and pressure turn them fossils. These fern fossils are from the Pottsville Formation in the coal region of the Appalachian Mountains in Pennsylvania. They date back to the middle of the Pennsylvanian age (about 350-290 million years ago)."

Coal is… Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Sulfur
How Coal is Made
The Sun Lights and Heats the Earth. Plants Transform Solar Energy into Growth. When Plants Die, They Form Peat. Time, Pressure, and Heat Turn Plants into Coal. The Peat is Compressed in Sediment Layers to Form Lignite. Further Compression Forms Bituminous and Subbituminous Coal. The Older the Coal, the More Energy it Holds. Eventually, Anthracite Forms. We Turn Coal into Civilization. 
Stored Solar Energy
Each kilogram of coal contains 6.67 kW-h (kilowatt-hours) of energy. A kilogram of coal could power a 60-watt light bulb for 167 hours*.

Big,Welds,0,"Welds
Big Welds Need Big Skill
Welding these big machines together is an art and a science. The welds must be straight, sound, and strong. Certified welders work with metal compositions (the filler material to fuse the thick, heavy pieces together. See the bevels, or angled grooves, on the joints? These allow welders to completely fill the joint area between the materials and to get a 100% sound weld. The welder makes the first pass, carefully guiding the molten metal into the joint. Plate thickness and the stress and strain to be put on the part determine if more welds are needed. The welds are actually stronger than the metal that the welder has fused together. After the welds cool, they are X-rayed for quality acceptance.
Tig Welding. Stick Welding. Mig Welding. Gas Welding. 
Did You Know?
The world's first industrial robot was made to spot weld. It was an industrial motorized arm weighing a staggering two tons.
Welding Helmet
The dark-tinted lens shade and helmet protect the welder from flash burns and “arc eye,” a painful eye _____ caused by the UV rays given off during welding.
Welding Gloves
Welders choose their gloves according to which technique they're using. Gloves are made from different kinds of animal hides and provide various levels of finger dexterity. They protect the welder from flames and electric shock.
Work Boots
Steel toe protects the welder from dropped equipment.
Welding Sleeves
Provides light protection against the flames and sparks while keeping the welder cool.
Welding Jacket
Protects the welder from heat, UV radiation, spatter, and sparks. 
Work Pants
Many welders prefer 100% cotton pants, like jeans, because they’re flame resistant and breathable. 
Welding Apron
Thick leather protects the welder from slag, flying sparks, and metal spatter.
Sparks Fly!
Welding produces very bright light, sparks, and extreme heat. Welders use several types of personal protective equipment (PPE) to stay safe. A welding helmet and safety glasses protect your eyes from sparks and UV radiation. Welding helmets have a dark lens to filter out bright light and to allow you to see the weld clearly. Welding gloves and a welding jacket protect your hands and body from heat, sparks, and slag. Slag is a by-product formed by the impurities in a metal that come out when heating metal to really high temperatures. The gloves are made of durable leather or Kevlar, and the jacket is made of a durable, flame-resistant material like cotton or wool.

Innovation Station,"Dampers, Valves, & Actuators",5,"Dampers, Valves, & Actuators
A damper is a plate that pivots open to allow warm or cool air into a room. It closes when the roam becomes too warm or too cool. Dampers are controlled by thermostats and moved by actuators. An actuator is a device that turns the energy of compressed air into a linear motion. They are connected to dampers by a series of linkages.
Johnson's Pneumatic System
When the thermostat reaches a set temperature, it sends a signal to an electropneumatic valve to turn the air pressure either on or off.
Air Pressure ON
A rubber diaphragm on the actuator inflates, which pushes on the linkages and opens the damper.
Air Pressure OFF
The rubber diaphragm deflates, the linkages relax, and the damper closes."

One Brain to Rule them All
Human beings are pretty complicated. We have lots of systems. Circulatory, nervous, muscular, skeletal, digestive, respiratory, immune, and a few others. Each system depends on the others, and your body needs them all to work well in order for you to work well. Imagine if each of your systems had its own ""brain"" and those ""brains"" couldn't communicate with each other.
That would be a problem. Fortunately, all your systems are run by one complex, beautiful brain. Buildings are complicated, too, and they rely on many different systems. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, lighting, security, fire protection. These systems have different controls and are made by different companies. Until recently, this meant lots of different ""brains"" that couldn't really interact. Metasys® is a complex, beautiful brain for buildings. Metasys® allows you to control all of a building's systems. It works with older systems and even systems from other manufacturers. It works online. It works on tablets and smartphones. Warren Johnson built a system that allowed you to control your environment. That was revolutionary back in the 19th Century. Today you trust Johnson Controls to deliver heating and cooling, giving you piece of mind. Today you rely on Johnson Controls to ensure your place of work or school is safe, secure, and comfortable environment. "

Innovation Station,Spark Gap Telegraph,3,"Wireless Telegraph
In the late 1800s, the telegraph was the only way to send an instant message to someone. The telegraph transformed the world and made communication much easier across distances. The problem was wires. You can't run wires from the shore to a ship, and ships were incredibly important to the global economy. People needed instant communication everywhere, and they needed to get rid of the wires. Warren Johnson's initial transmitter set-up consisted of a battery, a capacitor, an induction coil, and a spark gap. When you complete the circuit, the induction coil transforms low-voltage electricity from the battery into a high-voltage impulse, which jumps across the gap. This generates a pulse of radio waves that flies off in every direction. A coherer (radio-wave receiver) located somewhere else picks up this pulse of radio waves as a burst of static. A short burst of static became a Morse Code dot. A longer burst became a dash. Eventually, Johnson and his engineer Charles Fortier demonstrated their wireless telegraph system at the 1900 Paris Exposition with luminaries like Nikola Tesla, Guglielmo Marconi, and Thomas Edison."

You could create a code. Each letter might be combination of short and long bursts of electricity. Dots and dashes (and empty space). Tiny bits of empty space between letters. Longer bits of empty space between words. You want your code to be as efficient as possible, so you assign the shortest series of dots and dashes to the letters we use most frequently.

History Of The Solid Body Guitar
Like Nothing That Had Come Before...
Ever since the days of Rhubarb Red, Les had bought and played Gibson guitars. His very first was a Gibson L-50 arch top, acquired with the help of Sunny Joe Wolverton. Then came the L-5s and that fateful trip to the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo. From that moment on, Les was hooked! So, when he began experimenting in earnest with his solid-body sound, Les took his tinkerings to Gibson. At that time, Gibson wasn't convinced a solid-body with superior tone and resonance could be successfully built. Almost a decade later, the tables would turn. Gibson approached Les Paul in 1951 about collaborating on a design for a solid-body guitar. Fender had introduced a version, and Gibson was ready to see a future for solid-body sound. Taking Les's ""Log"" concept to the next stage, Gibson and Les modeled their solid-body into a whole sound instrument. That meant integrating each individual section until it resonated as a single piece of supremely refined tone wood. More than anything else, this set their solid body apart as an electric guitar that became, and remains, the industry standard for quality, design and playability. Today, Gibson continues to follow the same labor intensive, handmade process that assures each Gibson Les Paul model is a work of playable art."
Les Paul's House of Sound,Guitar Pickups,4,"Typical “Humbucking” Guitar Pickup
Humbucking pickups are two single coil pickups wired together, each at an opposing polarity. The differing magnetic polarities cancel each other out, allowing the electrical output to come through without the ambient hum that occurs with single coil pickups. Another unintended consequence of the humbucker is that the sound created is heavier and more complex than that from a single coil pickup. Many electric guitars have multiple pickups in varying locations. Each pickup detects different frequencies with greater or less success. These characteristics allow each pickup its own best sound.
Standard “Single Coil” Guitar Pickup
Together, coils and magnets turn motion into electrical energy. In this case, the vibrations are turned into electrical energy and passed along as a vibrating current in the coil. The number of coils around the magnet, the diameter of the wire, and the position of each coil on the body of the guitar all provide variation in the sound produced. The pickup's coil sends the signal through a simple circuit that includes a pass through two resistors, one that regulates tone and another that controls amplification.
Standard “Single Coil” Guitar Pickup with Screw used as magnets
There are different types of pickups. Some are adjustable, others are not, but the rule is, the closer the magnet is to the string, the stronger the signal. In an adjustable pickup, a screw sits between the pole pieces that can be raised and lowered to achieve the desired signal strength."

Les Paul's House of Sound,Les & Leo,5,"Les & Leo
Gibson vs. Fender is one of music history's most iconic rivalries, yet Leo Fender and Les Paul shared a surprising friendship. Leo, a passionate electronics tinkerer who didn’t actually play guitar, started with a radio repair studio where he made his name selling musical equipment like public address systems, amplifiers, and Hawaiian guitars. He would often visit Les Paul's garage studio in L.A. where they discussed electronics and solid-body electric guitars. Leo created his first electric guitar prototype based off these visits and offered it to Les, inviting him to join Fender, but Les chose to stay with Gibson. The Telecaster, available in 1951, was the world’s first mass-produced and commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Initially mocked for resembling a boat paddle, musicians soon discovered that Fender had provided them with a great-sounding, easily playable, and affordable instrument. It quickly became one of the most influential sounds of the 20th century, shaping the evolution of Rock 'n' Roll, R&B, and Country music. Seeing the success of Fender's Telecaster, Gibson got back in contact with Les Paul to create their own electric guitar. Les, who had figured out much of the invention in the decade earlier, said, “Fender was out first but I was way, way, way out front,” allowing for the quick release of the Gibson Les Paul in 1952. Les acknowledged Leo Fender's impact, stating, ""Leo did me a favor. I couldn't move Gibson with an atomic bomb. It took Leo Fender to wake Gibson up."" This rivalry spurred innovation, shaping their distinct guitar sounds."

Flip-able harmonica holder
Harmonica holders were available in the 1920s, but they held the harmonica in one position. When he was around 13 years old, Les was playing his guitar and harmonica in public.

Iris Colleen Summers was Mary Ford's birth name. She was one of seven musical siblings whose father was a revival preacher. In 1944, Colleen was backing country singers as part of the Sunshine Girls trio. At the same time, Les Paul was living in Hollywood and looking for a female singer for his country music radio show. A friend suggested he listen to the Sunshine Girls. Les was impressed and called Colleen to audition. Colleen's friends knew she was a huge Les Paul fan. Surely one of her friends was pulling a prank. But she agreed to the audition. When the evening for the audition came, Les forgot about the meeting. He was mowing his lawn in a checkered shirt, baggy army pants and his old army boots. He hadn't even shaved. Colleen pulled up, ""Can you tell me where the Les Paul studios are?"" She followed Les' directions to the garage recording studio. The only way in was to climb through a window. Quite a bit later when Les crawled through the window, Colleen exclaimed, ""That's not Les Paul! That's the gardener!"" As she scrambled for the exit, Les picked up his guitar and let go with a fast run. Colleen stopped, ""Oh my, you are Les Paul."" For the radio show Colleen was ""Mary Lou."" Later, while the two were in Wisconsin, Les decided Colleen needed a new stage name. He picked up a Milwaukee phone book. They settled on ""Mary Ford."""

Focusing on the Future
When Les was 32, he and Mary Skidded off an icy bridge and down a ravine. Mary wasn’t badly hurt, but Les was a mess of broken bones. One doctor advised amputating Les’ shattered right arm, but Dr. Robert Knight - a fan - saved it. The best option was the fix the arm in place. Les had the surgeon set it so he’d still be able to play. During recovery, Les focused on his future. “The doctors said there was potential nerve damage, that I shouldn’t count on regaining full use of the hand, but I wasn’t buying it. I was determined it was going to come back and that I would play again.”
Meeting Bing
Bing Crosby’s weekly NBC radio show was the top show in America, and a 29-year-old Les Paul wanted to be on it. He didn’t know Bing, but left New York determined to meet him in Hollywood. After becoming a staff musician at NBC, Les noticed Bing’s habit of going into a tiny room for a few minutes of quiet before the show. One day, Les had his trio in that room rehearsing a hot number when Bing walked in. Bing hired all of them on the spot. “Being associated with Bing was a major step up.”
Persuading Gibson
As a young man of 26, Les went to Gibson with his solid body electric guitar, nicknamed ""the Log."" Despite its sweet tone and lack of feedback, Gibson turned it down, calling it a ""broomstick with pickups on it."" Les spent the next 10 years trying to convince Gibson to build a solid body electric guitar. Les' friend Leo Fender developed a solid body electric and gave Les a prototype. Les took the Fender Telecaster to Gibson, along with ""the Log."" ""I believe the solid body guitar is going to be very important, and if you don't do something, Fender is going to rule the world."" Les finally persuaded Gibson to design what became one of the most famous guitars in the world, the Les Paul Standard."

He connected a radio as an amplifier to his acoustic guitar, but he wanted to hear just the strings vibrate and he wanted the strings to vibrate longer. ""Using a short length of steel railroad rail and two railroad spikes, I invented a device that could give me a consistent reference point for my experiments. I took a guitar string and fastened it at each end of the steel rail, using the spikes like a bridge and nut to raise the string so it could be plucked. Then I took a telephone microphone, wired it into Mom's radio for amplification, and placed it on the rail under the string. I soon figured out that the tremendous solidity of the rail allowed the string's vibration to sustain for a longer time, and there was no feedback."" -Excerpted from Les Paul: In His Own Words"

Les Paul's House of Sound,Recording Lathe,5,"Les' Recording Lathe
This little recording lathe was the very beginning of multi-track recording. Les built the thing so that the Les Paul Trio (Jimmy Atkins, Ernie Newton, Les Paul) could record themselves, listen, and get better. Les called the lathe ""barbaric"", but we think he was being a little hard on himself. Ingenious is a much better word. One day when Jimmy and Ernie weren't around, Les wanted to record something on his own. He added a second playback arm so that he could record the rhythm guitar section (Jimmy usually played rhythm guitar) on one side of the groove. Then he would play the bass line (Ernie was the bass player) and record that on the other side of the groove. Finally Les would play his part along with the first two recordings, capturing it all on one disc. Sound on Sound was born."
Les Paul's House of Sound,Recording Wizard,5,"1. Multitrack Recordings on Discs
In his early 30s, Les used a disc recorder in a brand-new way to make multiple-track recordings using flat discs that most people called ""records."" How did he do it? 1. Record the first guitar part on disc #1. 2. Play disc #1 while recording another guitar part with it onto disc #2. 3. Play two-layer disc #2 while recording a third part with it onto disc #3. 4. Repeat until done! Les released ""Lover,"" his first song using this technique, in 1948.
2. The Evolution of Multiple Track Recording
Today, computers make it easy to record multiple tracks, overdub and add effects. But Les had to figure out how to do it himself, inventing recording techniques so he'd sound different from all other electric guitar players. Les Paul's ideas and techniques influenced other innovators, just as Les had been inspired during his career.
3. Overdubbing Tracks on Magnetic Tape
When Les was 33, Bing Crosby gave him one of the first Ampex tape recorders. Les added an extra playback head and achieved the same multi-track effect on tape that he had created on discs. But adding a new track erased the previous recording. A mistake meant starting from scratch.
Recording Multiple Tracks While Preserving the Originals
""My invention was to stack the heads one on top of the other so they were all aligned in the same place, and you could use the same multiple head for recording and playback.... I turned to my friends in San Francisco, Ampex, and they.. agreed to build the thing for me. It didn't really become functional until 1957, when we finally redesigned it ourselves to get it right.” With the eight-track recorder, Les could record and mix tracks while preserving each original track separately. It was easy to make changes without starting over and with no loss of audio quality. This type of tape recording remained state-of-the-art until the advent of high-quality digital recording in the late 1990s."
Les Paul's House of Sound,Seeing Sound,2,"Seeing Sound
How would you measure the speed of sound?
In 1886, August Kundt generated a single frequency of sound - a pure tone inside a tube. Dust inside the tube began to vibrate and dance, forming the outline of the soundwave. Kundt then figured out that the distance between the dancing piles of dust is the wavelength of the sound wave. Since he knew the frequency of the sound wave, he could multiply that number by the wavelength and find the speed of sound in air. "
Les Paul's House of Sound,The Klunker,5,"The Klunker
An electric guitar produces sound when the strings vibrate. This vibration creates an electrical signal which is picked up by magnets wrapped with coils of fine wire. The magnets, otherwise known as pickups, allow us to hear the music of a guitar. By tinkering with the pickups on The Klunker, moving them up and down, apart and together; winding the coil tight and loose, backward and forward, Les learned he could modify the sound of an electric guitar by changing the placement combinations of the pickups."
Les Paul's House of Sound,The Log,5,"The Log
Les was in New York in 1941 and his guitar-playing career had taken off but he was haunted by the beautiful sound of his rail guitar. He had friends at the Epiphone factory who let him have access to their guitar-making equipment on Sundays when the factory was closed. Les worked tirelessly on creating an electrically amplified guitar that didn't have feedback and provided volume, tone and sustain that he could control. Les took a 4 x 4 piece of pine and strung it like a guitar, added his homemade pickups, a bridge, a Virola tailpiece, strings and the neck of an Epiphone Broadway guitar. He got the sound he wanted and called it ""the Log"". When he took the ""Log"" to a nightclub to play, the audience was unimpressed. Les was determined and so he then took an old Epiphone guitar, sawed it in half and gave his Log Epiphone ""wings"" so it would look more like a guitar. He then took the Log with wings to the same nightclub, played a few tunes and the audience couldn't stop talking about the ""new sound."" Les concluded, ""People hear with their eyes."" Les was so confident after that with his ""Log"" guitar that he took it to show some of the Epiphone executives, but they weren't interested. He later took his invention to Gibson, where they laughed and called the Log ""a broomstick with pickups."" It took another ten years for Gibson to accept the idea of a solid body electric guitar. In 1951, Gibson called Les and worked closely with him to design and build what has become the Gibson Les Paul solid body electric guitar. The first models were sold in 1952, and remain one of the top selling guitars in the world."
Les Paul's House of Sound,The Octopus,5,"The Octopus
Les got the idea for this monster back in 1953. He wanted true multi-track recording, a device that would allow him to record multiple, independent tracks that were synced together. His friends at Ampex had helped him in the past, and they jumped at the chance to build something so revolutionary. It took them about a year to build it, and it cost Les $14,000. Les wasn't happy. ""The speeds were off, the EQ was unacceptable, and there was a million other bugs that had not been worked out"", said Les. So he shipped it back. Ampex worked on it some more. They shipped it back. This went on for a while. Les still wasn't happy. Four years later, in 1957, Les and his design guy, Rein Narma, finally got it right, and Les was able to record. You're looking at the first true 8-track recorder, the machine that changed music forever."
Les Paul's House of Sound,The Paulverizer,5,"The Paulverizer
What began as a joke now took physical form. The Paulverizer had been an easy way to explain the level of complexity Les was able to achieve while in the studio using Sound on Sound. For the first time, however, he was incorporating multi-track tape recording in a live audience setting. The enigmatic black box affectionately dubbed, The Paulverizer, became the means to operate two tape machines he placed off stage. From his guitar, he could control which tracks were played and still leave room for improvisation!"
Les Paul's House of Sound,Theremin,2,"Theremin
This instrument is ""hands-off""! The Theremin makes sound without being touched. It works by detecting how close you are to its two antennas. The tube antenna controls pitch (how high or low the sound is), and the flat antenna controls volume (how loud or soft the sound is). Moving your hands closer or farther away from the antennas changes the electric charge, which the theremin translates into sound."
MKE Muscle,Bernoulli Table,2,"Bernoulli's Principle & Flight
Slower moving fluids (liquid or gas) exert more pressure than faster moving fluids. An aircraft's wing is curved on top and flat on the bottom. Air traveling over the top of the wing moves faster than under the wing. This generates higher pressure on the bottom of the wing, causing lift."
MKE Muscle,Energy Into Motion,3,"Energy Into Motion
The force of the explosion drives a piston downward. The piston drives a connector rod. The connector rod drives the crankshaft. The crankshaft turns the up and down motion of the engine into a circular motion that drives the wheels."
MKE Muscle,Excavator,2,"Multiplying the Multiplier
A lever can help you lift a boulder. A lever and a hydraulic cylinder can help you move a mountain. On this excavator, each hydraulic cylinder is attached to a moving part of the excavator. The pressure from the hydraulic pump is multiplied by the cylinder and again by the boom, arm, and bucket, which act like levers.
The Hydraulic Circuit
A hydraulic circuit is kind of like an electrical circuit.
There are hoses instead of wires and fluid instead of electricity. Instead of the electromotive force (Volts) pushing electrons along, a pump pushes fluid through the circuit. In a hydraulic circuit, the engine turns the hydraulic pump. The pump pushes fluid through a hose to the control valve. Valves choose the route the fluid takes. For instance, the valve can route the fluid to extend or retract the cylinder's piston. The pistons inside the cylinders extend and contract the arm, and the bucket.
Why Hydraulic Power?
• Simplicity! Eliminate the gears, cams, chain drives, and pulleys.
• Efficiency! Fewer moving parts means a more efficient machine!
• Power! Transform small forces into incredibly large forces!
• Control! Manage large forces with small forces!
• Flexibility! Transmit force into difficult spaces!

Physics & You,Info Panels - Physics Concepts,-,"What Is ENERGY?
That's a big question. Energy is... a thing. A property of matter. It can be turned into work, though not always. It can be stored, sometimes for millions or billions of years. It can be transferred from one form to another. Energy, to put it simply, ""makes everything go"". Energy makes humans go. We run on the chemical energy stored in food. This energy comes, indirectly, from the sun. We transform this energy into work and play and laughter and everything else. Energy makes our world go. Civilization runs on the chemical energy stored in stuff we set on fire - oil, natural gas, coal, garbage, wood, etc.* This energy comes, indirectly, from the sun. We transform this stored energy into heat and electricity, which we turn into work.
Energy cannot be created. It cannot be destroyed. It can only be transferred. But what is energy? That's a big question.
*Increasingly, we also transform the energy of wind, falling water, and the sun into heat and electricity and work.
What Is GRAVITY?
That depends on who you ask. Sir Isaac Newton described Gravity mathematically, but he had no idea what it was. He decided it was a Force. Other than that, he wouldn't even make a guess. Albert Einstein figured out that Gravity is really the warping of spacetime caused by matter. The Earth orbits the sun because the Sun's enormous mass warps the fabric of spacetime, creating a ""dent"" in the Universe that the Earth and the other planets follow. The Earth creates its own ""dent"" in the fabric of spacetime that the moon follows. You also make a
""dent"" in the fabric of spacetime. Not a very big one, though.
What is ACCELERATION?
A skydiver leaps out of an airplane and plummets towards Earth. She accelerates in a downward direction at roughly 10 meters per second per second. Soon there is a balance between air resistance and gravity, as our skydiver reaches a constant speed of 54 meters per second or 122 miles per hour. 122 miles per hour is not an optimal landing speed, so our skydiver (as intelligent as she is intrepid), opens her parachute. The parachute increases the amount of air resistance, slowing her descent. She accelerates again, this time in the opposite direction. Acceleration is a change in speed and direction in a given amount of time. So it can mean both ""speeding up"" and ""slowing down"". What we call ""deceleration"" is simply acceleration in the opposite direction.
What Is FRICTION?
Why do your hands get warm when you rub them together rapidly for a few seconds? Why do car engines need oil? Friction. Slide two surfaces against each other and the result is friction. Friction is a resistive force that slows things down as it transforms motion into heat. Friction also happens within fluids and inside materials as they bend. Your hands get warm because friction transforms the motion of your hands into heat. Your car needs oil because without it, all those moving parts in the engine would grind together creating an incredible amount of wear and an incredible amount of heat in a very short amount of time. Friction isn't all bad. There's plenty of friction between the road and the tires on your car, which allows you to do neat things like steer and turn.
What Is TIME?
We understand time on a human scale - moments, days, seasons, and years. We measure Time by the periodic motion of pendulums or the periodic vibrations of quartz crystals and cesium atoms. We use Time to coordinate our lives. But what is Time? What is it made of? We know that it is part of the fabric of the universe, that it is bound up with entropy, that events are irreversible, that we remember the past but not the future. We know that in the far distant future, when the universe reaches a fully disordered state, time will cease to be. Of course, the most important question is... can we build a time machine and go see it?
What Is FORCE?
A force is a push or pull in a given direction. The Force is an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together."
Physics & You,Info Panels - Newton's Laws,-,"Meet ISAAC NEWTON
Isaac Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and chemist. Building on the work of Galileo and Johannes Kepler, Newton mathematically described the Laws of Motion and Gravity way back in 1687. He also invented Calculus. Newton didn't get everything right (honestly, who does?), but he got a lot right. He helped build the foundations of modern science.
""I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore... whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."" - Isaac Newton
Newton's First Law of Motion INERTIA
Place a soccer ball on a field, and it just sits there. The forces acting on the soccer ball - gravity and the upward force of the ground holding up the ball - are balanced. The ball is at rest. Unless something happens to it, the soccer ball will stay at rest until the end of time. That's inertia, a property of matter. Now take that soccer ball, get in a rocket, and soar into interstellar space. Put on your spacesuit, grab the soccer ball, and exit the rocket. Give the soccer ball a good kick. At first the soccer ball will accelerate until it reaches a constant speed. If no other forces act on the soccer ball, it will travel at a constant speed in a constant direction until the end of time. This, too, is inertia. Newton's First Law states that objects tend to remain at rest or in motion at a constant speed unless acted upon by an outside, unbalanced force.
Newton's Second Law of Motion FORCE = MASS x ACCELERATION
You're on a soccer field. In front of you is a soccer ball at rest. The forces acting on the soccer ball are balanced.
You are about to change that. You give the soccer ball a big kick. You have provided an outside, unbalanced force. And the soccer ball is no longer at rest. It has accelerated and is sailing through the air down the field. How much force did you give the soccer ball? What was its rate of acceleration? What is the mass of the soccer ball? Newton's Second Law allows you to figure all of this out. The Second Law also states that the rate of acceleration depends on the mass of the object and the size of the force. With a good kick, you can send a soccer ball down the field. The same kick will not send a car down the field. A car, as you already know, has more mass than a soccer ball. Don't kick cars.
Newton's Third Law of Motion ACTION & REACTION
Go ahead and jump straight up into the air. Well done. You used your legs and feet to push yourself upward against the Earth. You also pushed the entire Earth downward with exactly the same amount of force. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in direction) reaction. You jumped up. The entire Earth moved downward. Just a very little bit. The Earth is much more massive than you are."

A sail doesn't just catch the air and pull the boat along like a reverse parachute. A sail is really a wing turned on its side. Air flows faster over the curved side of the sail, creating high pressure on the other side. This lifting force pushes the boat both sideways and forward. The strength and directions of the lifting force depend on the angle of the sail. How does a sailboat go forward if the lifting force is also pushing it sideways? The sailboat has another wing in the water, sometimes more than one. The rudder and centerboard cancel out most of the sideways force. The sailboat moves mostly forward."

This energy drives weather and life. Energy cannot be created on earth - it can only be transformed from solar energy into different types of energy. Plants transform about 3,000 exajoules of this solar energy through photosynthesis. Humans transform and use around 500 exajoules of energy each year. Our energy comes from different sources, including coal, oil, natural gas, water and wind, and directly from the Sun itself.

The Study of Tree Rings Through Time
Developed in the early 1900s by the astronomer A. E. Douglass, who when he discovered that tree rings record sunspot activity. Each tree ring is a measure of time, and trees from the same area have very similar patterns of ring growth. Wooden beams and timber from a site can be accurately dated by matching the rings to a regions timeline. The first archaeological application occured in 1919, when Douglass used tree-ring analysis to measure the construction dates of two sites in the U.S. southwest."
The Distance Mirror,Meresamun Mummy,4,"Meresamun Mummy
Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning is a technology used by archaeologists to digitally excavate mummies without damaging their delicate interiors. This is a CT scan of a circa 3000-year-old Egyptian mummy, now housed at the Oriental Museum of Chicago. According to the hieroglyphs on the sarcophagus, the mummy's name was Meresamun, which means ""She Lives for the Amun”. Meresamun was a musician who held the title ""Singer in the Interior Temple of Amun"". The CT scan reveals that Meresamun was a woman with strong cheekbones and wide-set eyes. She had a slight overbite and retained all of her teeth, which were worn down by years of eating coarse, stone ground flour. The scan also reveals a large amount of linen used by her embalmers to wrap the body and fill empty organ cavities. Can you find other physical evidence about how Meresamun might have lived?

The Distance Mirror,MKE Historical Sites,5,"Prehistoric Burial Mound
The last of a group of Native American Mounds formerly located on a Stone Age village site near this spot and destroyed in recent years. Several were of larger size. Also the last of many fine groups of burial, linear, and animal shaped mounds formerly located within the present limits of the City of Milwaukee. Effigy mounds are burial sites made of earth and are common in Wisconsin's landscape. Many were constructed in the shapes of like animals and spirits. Other mounds are conical or linear shapes. Another variation in the style of mounds is the Panther Intaglio in Fort Atkinson, which is an indentation in the ground that fills up with water when it rains. Most mounds were built by Late Woodland Period people, between A.D. 750 and 1200. More often than not, effigy mounds occur in groups along with other kinds of mounds. During the 1800s, European-American archaeologists assumed indigenous people did not build the mounds and attributed them to a nebulous race of ""mound-builders."" Excavations of these mounds in the late 1800s revealed native artifacts and skeletal remains, settling the debate.
More than 3,000 effigy sites, that are known of, once existed in Wisconsin, but fewer than 10 percent of those remain.
First African American Church Built in Wisconsin
St. Mark African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first African American church built in Wisconsin, once stood on this site. The property was purchased in 1869, the year the congregation was organized. Construction on the St. Mark A.M.E. church began in November 1886, under the direction of Rev. William R. Alexander, pastor. Dedicatory services were held on April 3, 1887. The St. Mark congregation spent 43 years at this site, during which time the membership grew and the church, known as the Friendly Church, became the center of religious, civic, and cultural affairs for the African American community.
Bayview Rolling Mill
Near this site in Bay View stood the Milwaukee Iron Company rolling mill, the first major heavy industry in the region and an important producer of iron and steel for the Midwest. The mill, which opened in 1868, transformed ore from Dodge County and Lake Superior area mines into iron products, including thousands of tons of rail for the region's growing railroads. By 1885, more than 1,500 people were employed at the plant, some recruited from the iron-producing districts of the British Isles, and the village of Bay View grew from a rural crossroads into an industrial community surrounding the rolling mill. On May 5, 1886, the mill was the scene of a major labor disturbance. Nearly 1500 strikers from around Milwaukee marched on the Bay View mill to dramatize their demand for an eight-hour work day. The local militia, called to the scene by Governor Jeremiah Rusk, fired on the crowd, killing seven people. The mill closed in 1929, and the buildings were demolished a decade later. But the community of Bay View remains, a neighborhood of mill workers' houses, shops, and churches.
Lueddemann's-On-The River
This park played a key role in Shorewood's development. In 1872, Frederick A. Lueddemann opened Lueddemann's-On-The-River on this site in the Town of Milwaukee. Otto Zwietusch bought the resort in 1876 and renamed it Mineral Springs Park. Envisioning a landscaped urban retreat, he replaced the original building with a large building featuring apartments, a restaurant, and billiard rooms. The park was purchased in 1900 and renamed Coney Island. Its owners added a roller coaster, loud music and garish lights. These changes prompted growing dissatisfaction with the Town of Milwaukee which was collecting license fees. In 1900, the community incorporated as the Village of East Milwaukee, renamed Shorewood in 1917. Ravenna Park, the last in a succession of parks, closed in 1916. The grounds were subdivided and the structures removed. Only Hubbard Park remains from the original Lueddemann's-On-The-River.
National Soldiers' Home
The Wisconsin Soldiers' Home Association was formed in 1864 by a coalition of women's charitable organizations led by Lydia Hewitt, Hannah Vedder, and Mrs. E. L. Buttrick of Milwaukee. The Association raised funds to endow a hospital where sick and wounded Civil War soldiers could receive medical treatment and long-term domiciliary care. After securing a state appropriation of $5000, the Association staged a spectacular public event known as the Soldiers' Home Fair, which opened in Milwaukee on June 29, 1865, and raised more than $110,000. The proceeds from the Soldiers' Home Fair enabled the Association to purchase land and establish a hospital. In 1867, the Association transferred its property and remaining funds to the federal government for the establishment of the National Asylum for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Northwestern Branch. Dr. Erastus B. Wolcott of Milwaukee, the state's surgeon general during the Civil War, was appointed by Congress to head the governing board of the Home. In 1869, the noted architect Edward Townsend Mix designed the High Victorian Gothic structure ""Old Main,"" now known as Building No. 2. The hospital was renamed the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Administration Medical Center in 1985.
Rescue of Joshua Glover
Joshua Glover was a runaway slave who sought freedom in Racine in 1852. In 1854, his Missouri owner used the Fugitive Slave Act to apprehend him. This 1850 law permitted slave catchers to cross state lines to capture escaped slaves. Glover was taken to Milwaukee and imprisoned. Word spread about Glover's incarceration and a great crowd gathered around the jail demanding his release. They beat down the jail door and released Joshua Glover. He was eventually escorted to Canada and safety. The Glover incident helped galvanize abolitionist sentiment in Wisconsin. This case eventually led the state supreme court to defy the federal government by declaring the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional."

Objects may not always be what they seem. Knowing where you are in its timeline is as important as when and where the object comes from.
Sherit, the mummy, was actually a child.
Advanced technology has allowed reserchers to look inside the sarcophogus of this 2000-year-old mummy from Eygpt. So much information was gathered that scientists were able to reconstruct her face without ever opening her casket.
Petrified Man? The Cardiff Giant.
This 10 foot-tall ""petrified man"" was found in 1869. George Hull had a carver work a piece of gypsum into the figure of a man, stain it with acids, and beat the figure with a board full of needles to ""age"" the stone. Although declared a fake by archaeologists and geologists, it didn't stop PT Barnum from forming a plaster replica of the Giant, then calling the original a fake.

Virtual Explorer,Virtual Explorer,1,"How Does the VR System Know Where I Am?
Lighthouse Sensors are active, infrared sensors that emit a burst of invisible light 60 times per second. They also send a beam of invisible laser light sweeping across the room. The Vive headset is covered in photosensors that start counting the millisecond they detect these bursts of infrared light. They stop counting when they're hit by the laser. The Lighthouses use this information to determine the position of the headset. Since you are wearing the headset, the Lighthouse Sensors know exactly where you are. The Vive controllers also 'talk' to the Lighthouse Sensors, helping track your actions."
