# HacksGiving 2024

Thank you for participating in the HacksGiving 2024 competition!

In collaboriation with MSOE and Discovery World, AI-Club is hoping to provide an opportunity for our talented students to gain more hands-on AI experience for the chance to compete in a $6000, 3-day hackathon -- as well as build solutions that ultimately help a non-profit organization that traditionally is unable to invest into AI solutions!

For more information about what an appropriate solution looks like, as well as important dates, please refer to the [Hacksgiving 2024 Hackathon Rubric](https://msoe365-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/paulsonb_msoe_edu/EX0dvg_FoDhKtmmQ3XLFfU8BXIaFs-7M-KAi3iSwvyQ7lQ?e=A5GBIf)
